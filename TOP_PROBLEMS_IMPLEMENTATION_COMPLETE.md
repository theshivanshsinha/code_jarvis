## üèÜ **Features Added**

### **1. Backend API Endpoint**

- **Route**: `/api/stats/top-problems`
- **Method**: GET
- **Query Parameters**:
  - `platform`: Filter by platform (all, leetcode, codeforces, atcoder)
  - `difficulty`: Filter by difficulty (all, easy, medium, hard)
  - `category`: Filter by category (all, classic, interview, contest, beginner)
  - `limit`: Number of problems to return (default: 50)

### **2. Curated Problem Database**

Added hand-picked problems from:

- **LeetCode**: Classic interview problems (Two Sum, Reverse Linked List, Valid Parentheses, etc.)
- **Codeforces**: Beginner-friendly problems (Watermelon, Theatre Square, Way Too Long Words, etc.)

- **Hover Effects**: Interactive UI with smooth transitions

### **4. Advanced Filtering System**

- **Platform Filter**: Filter by specific competitive programming platforms
- **Difficulty Filter**: Easy, Medium, Hard problem selection
- **Category Filter**: Classic, Interview Prep, Contest, Beginner categories
- **Real-time Updates**: Filters apply automatically without page refresh
- **Active Filter Indicators**: Visual feedback when filters are applied
- **Reset Functionality**: One-click filter reset

### **5. Enhanced User Experience**

- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations and feedback
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and retry options
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no problems match filters
- **Problem Statistics**: Shows solve count and acceptance rate
- **External Integration**: Links to more problem sets

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes (stats.py)**

```python
@stats_bp.get("/top-problems")
def top_problems():
    """Get curated list of top problems to solve from different platforms"""
    # Filter and return curated problems with advanced filtering logic

def _get_curated_problems():
    """Return curated list of top competitive programming problems"""
    # Hand-curated database of 25+ high-quality problems
```

### **Frontend Changes (Home.jsx)**

```javascript
function TopProblems() {
  // Comprehensive component with:
  // - State management for problems and filters
  // - Real-time API integration
  // - Interactive filter controls
  // - Responsive card layout
  // - Error handling and loading states
}
```

### **Problem Data Structure**

```javascript
{
    "id": "two-sum",
    "title": "Two Sum",
    "platform": "leetcode",
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "rating": null,
    "url": "https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/",
    "description": "Given an array of integers...",
    "tags": ["Array", "Hash Table"],
    "categories": ["classic", "interview"],
    "solveCount": "10M+",
    "acceptance": "49.1%"
}
```

## üé® **Design Features**

### **Visual Design**

- **Dark Theme**: Consistent with application design
- **Platform Branding**: Color-coded badges (LeetCode orange, Codeforces blue, etc.)
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Clear problem titles and descriptions
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects and transitions

### **Interaction Design**

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Collapsible filter panel
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time filter application
- **Clear Actions**: Prominent "Solve" buttons on each problem
- **Quick Access**: Direct links to problem pages
- **Filter Management**: Easy reset and status indicators

### **Information Architecture**

- **Logical Grouping**: Problems organized by platform and difficulty
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: All necessary problem information
- **Clear Categorization**: Multiple filtering dimensions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without filters, enhanced with them

## üß™ **Testing**

Created comprehensive test suite: `test_top_problems.html`

- **API Endpoint Testing**: Validates backend functionality
- **Filter Logic Testing**: Tests all filter combinations
- **Interactive Testing**: UI for manual testing
- **Error Handling**: Tests edge cases and failures
- **Performance**: Validates response times and data integrity

## üìä **Problem Categories**
